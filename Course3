Graphs & Graph Algorithms
I learnt how to implement a graph using edge list, adjacency lists and adjacency matrix.
I learnt how to do BFS and DFS traversals on a graph.
I learnt how to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a vertex in a directed graph.

Stacks and Queues
I learn that in stacks objects are inserted and removed from same end
whereas in Queues the objects are inserted and removed from different ends.
in stack only one pointer is used it points at the top and in queues two pointers are used
they point to front and rear side.
